#### Write your blog posts

2. Or edit directly content files in `content/blog/` directory

#### Customize your blog

1. Update configuration by editing `config.yml` file
2. Change templates by copying files from [`themes/hyde/layouts/`](https://github.com/Cecilapp/theme-hyde/tree/master/layouts) to your own `layouts/` directory to _override_ them.
