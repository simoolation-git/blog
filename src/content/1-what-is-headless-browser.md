__What the hell is a Headless 🌐 Browser?!__
We all know what a web browser is since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web">World Wide Web</a> was introduced by Tim Berners-Lee 30 years ago! 
Its really in the name... a headless browser is a browser with no head! 
Well, if you consider the GUI the *head* 🤯 in this context!

__But what does that mean?__
well then lets back track to what a browser is. 
A web browser is a software application for accessing information on the World Wide Web.
A headless browser accesses the web using a command line interface and not a graphical interface.

__Why would we want to access web using a headless browser?__
When we dont care about the GUI, for instance in case of automated tests and scrpaing for website data.

__What is it improving?__
Not having to load GUI will result in needing less Ram in the process. 
so weather we are doing automated testing or scraping we can do it faster & cheaper!
